# Plant-microbe-interaction (pmi) meta-analysis

This repository contains data and code for Yan et al. 'A quantitative synthesis of soil microbial effects on plant species coexistence'.

The data directory contains data used in the main and supplementary analyses. 'data_live_ref.csv'
contains performance data of plant species where growth on live field-collected soil serves the reference. 'data_sterile_ref.csv' contains performance data of plant species where growth on multiple types of sterile soil serves the reference. 'crawford_yan_extractions.csv' contains original data extracted by Crawford et al. (2019), with part of them re-extracted by Yan et al. using WebPlotDigitizer to confirm the consistency of data extraction. 

The code directory contains the 'analysis.RMD' with all analysis code, and the knitted 'analysis.html' with an interactive webpage showing code and output.
